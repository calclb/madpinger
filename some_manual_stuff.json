Yes, it's especially good preparation for students considering careers in health or health-related fields. But since everyone deals with sickness and health at some point and learning about \"what matters\" to people is universally important, this course is relevant for everyone. RS 102 is one of the RS \"gateway\" courses: That is, it's designed for students who want to learn some things about religions and religion in general and we do this via an important theme (sickness/health). \nSkills Building: comparative and interdisciplinary analysis, writing (3 short essays), religious literacy and cultural competency; conversing among multiple viewpoints\nThis is the gateway course for the Religious Studies certificate and major and counts toward the Global Health Certificate. It is a core course for the Health and Humanities Certificate. The course has 3 FIG sections along with 5 regular sections. You can take it for Soc Sci or HUM credit (Z).  \nCourse Description\nHow do religious peoples understand and live in sickness and health? How\ndoes physical well-being connect to spiritual well-being? Medicine to\nmeaning-making? How does looking at religion in sickness and health\nprovide insight into its roles in different cultures and contexts? What is\n\"religion ? \"Sickness ? \"Health ? How can we understand their\nrelationships? From Southeast Asia to the Caribbean, Africa and the\nMediterranean, we'll approach these questions using perspectives from\nanthropology, history, sociology, legal studies and the medical sciences,\namong others. We'll learn how scholars of religion approach them. And\nwe'll be coming home to Wisconsin and the U.S. along the way to examine these\nquestions as well.\nCourse Learning Objectives\nThoughtful and prepared engagement in this class should lead you ~\n--To begin to develop global religious literacy. To understand some\nsignificant ways in which religious expressions close to home connect\nto situations and cultures around the world, particularly as they relate\nto sickness, health, and healing.\n--To understand something of the diversity of ways in which religion\nboth reflects and shapes human communities and self-conceptions, as\nillustrated mainly by some of the cultures influenced by Buddhism, forms of\nreligion with roots in Africa, and Christianity. (Other traditions are considered as well.)\n--To gain knowledge of and familiarity with some approaches to  interpreting  religion and to use these to examine a variety of religious expressions related to sickness and health. We'll also test these theories against the experiences and practices of people.\n--To learn and begin communicating in a vocabulary of religion and health in the humanities and social sciences and in thoughtful human discourse generally. (We'll learn a little bio-science too.)\n--To gain and practice skills in analytical reading, writing and thinking about religion and particularly its connections to health. These skills are widely applicable to courses and careers outside this\nclass and to being a global citizen and will help you continue to learn beyond this class.\n\nNo Prerequisites; especially suitable for first and second-year students.\nThis is not an old-fashioned \"intro to religions\" course in which you\nlearn several \"facts\"  about some major religions. You will indeed do that.\nBut this course focuses on helping you develop ideas and skills for\nunderstanding religion as a broad category and in specific contexts: a small\nvillage in Thailand, an immigrant community in Appleton, a hospital room\nin Chicago, a Medical School classroom in Madison. It aims to teach you\nhow to recognize and interpret religion and use your understanding for the\n\"health  of others and yourself of human communities.\n\nCourse materials, including required readings, are available via CANVAS.","typicalTopicsAndOrSchedule":"Sample Topics\nDance as Religion and Healing in Africa and the African Diaspora in the U.S.\nA Wisconsin Legal Case about religion and parental responsibility for child health\nSaints and other healing figures\nReligion and Health in Southeast Asia and Southeast Asian Communities in Wisconsin\nShamanism, Healing and Community\nGiving Birth in a Thai Hmong Village\nEnd of Life Choices: Redefining Medicine\nintegrating Native American Culture and Healthcare\nReligion in Hospitals: Nurses on the Front-line\nHow medical decisions are often religious decisions\nElders, Resilience and Covid","format":"2 lecture sessions and 1 discussion session per week.

Yes, it's especially good preparation for students considering careers in health or health-related fields. But since everyone deals with sickness and health at some point and learning about \"what matters\" to people is universally important, this course is relevant for everyone. RS 102 is one of the RS \"gateway\" courses: That is, it's designed for students who want to learn some things about religions and religion in general and we do this via an important theme (sickness/health). \nSkills Building: comparative and interdisciplinary analysis, writing (3 short essays), religious literacy and cultural competency; conversing among multiple viewpoints\nThis is the gateway course for the Religious Studies certificate and major and counts toward the Global Health Certificate. It is a core course for the Health and Humanities Certificate. The course has 3 FIG sections along with 5 regular sections. You can take it for Soc Sci or HUM credit (Z).  \nCourse Description\nHow do religious peoples understand and live in sickness and health? How\ndoes physical well-being connect to spiritual well-being? Medicine to\nmeaning-making? How does looking at religion in sickness and health\nprovide insight into its roles in different cultures and contexts? What is\n\"religion ? \"Sickness ? \"Health ? How can we understand their\nrelationships? From Southeast Asia to the Caribbean, Africa and the\nMediterranean, we'll approach these questions using perspectives from\nanthropology, history, sociology, legal studies and the medical sciences,\namong others. We'll learn how scholars of religion approach them. And\nwe'll be coming home to Wisconsin and the U.S. along the way to examine these\nquestions as well.\nCourse Learning Objectives\nThoughtful and prepared engagement in this class should lead you ~\n--To begin to develop global religious literacy. To understand some\nsignificant ways in which religious expressions close to home connect\nto situations and cultures around the world, particularly as they relate\nto sickness, health, and healing.\n--To understand something of the diversity of ways in which religion\nboth reflects and shapes human communities and self-conceptions, as\nillustrated mainly by some of the cultures influenced by Buddhism, forms of\nreligion with roots in Africa, and Christianity. (Other traditions are considered as well.)\n--To gain knowledge of and familiarity with some approaches to  interpreting  religion and to use these to examine a variety of religious expressions related to sickness and health. We'll also test these theories against the experiences and practices of people.\n--To learn and begin communicating in a vocabulary of religion and health in the humanities and social sciences and in thoughtful human discourse generally. (We'll learn a little bio-science too.)\n--To gain and practice skills in analytical reading, writing and thinking about religion and particularly its connections to health. These skills are widely applicable to courses and careers outside this\nclass and to being a global citizen and will help you continue to learn beyond this class.\n\nNo Prerequisites; especially suitable for first and second-year students.\nThis is not an old-fashioned \"intro to religions\" course in which you\nlearn several \"facts\"  about some major religions. You will indeed do that.\nBut this course focuses on helping you develop ideas and skills for\nunderstanding religion as a broad category and in specific contexts: a small\nvillage in Thailand, an immigrant community in Appleton, a hospital room\nin Chicago, a Medical School classroom in Madison. It aims to teach you\nhow to recognize and interpret religion and use your understanding for the\n\"health  of others and yourself of human communities.\n\nCourse materials, including required readings, are available via CANVAS.","typicalTopicsAndOrSchedule":"Sample Topics\nDance as Religion and Healing in Africa and the African Diaspora in the U.S.\nA Wisconsin Legal Case about religion and parental responsibility for child health\nSaints and other healing figures\nReligion and Health in Southeast Asia and Southeast Asian Communities in Wisconsin\nShamanism, Healing and Community\nGiving Birth in a Thai Hmong Village\nEnd of Life Choices: Redefining Medicine\nintegrating Native American Culture and Healthcare\nReligion in Hospitals: Nurses on the Front-line\nHow medical decisions are often religious decisions\nElders, Resilience and Covid","format":"2 lecture sessions and 1 discussion session per week.

How does looking at religion in sickness and health\nprovide insight into its roles in different cultures and contexts? What is\n\"religion ? \"Sickness ? \"Health ? How can we understand their\nrelationships? From Southeast Asia to the Caribbean, Africa and the\nMediterranean, we'll approach these questions using perspectives from\nanthropology, history, sociology, legal studies and the medical sciences,\namong others. We'll learn how scholars of religion approach them. And\nwe'll be coming home to Wisconsin and the U.S. along the way to examine these\nquestions as well.\nCourse Learning Objectives\nThoughtful and prepared engagement in this class should lead you ~\n--To begin to develop global religious literacy. To understand some\nsignificant ways in which religious expressions close to home connect\nto situations and cultures around the world, particularly as they relate\nto sickness, health, and healing.\n--To understand something of the diversity of ways in which religion\nboth reflects and shapes human communities and self-conceptions, as\nillustrated mainly by some of the cultures influenced by Buddhism, forms of\nreligion with roots in Africa, and Christianity. (Other traditions are considered as well.)\n--To gain knowledge of and familiarity with some approaches to  interpreting  religion and to use these to examine a variety of religious expressions related to sickness and health. We'll also test these theories against the experiences and practices of people.\n--To learn and begin communicating in a vocabulary of religion and health in the humanities and social sciences and in thoughtful human discourse generally. (We'll learn a little bio-science too.)\n--To gain and practice skills in analytical reading, writing and thinking about religion and particularly its connections to health. These skills are widely applicable to courses and careers outside this\nclass and to being a global citizen and will help you continue to learn beyond this class.\n\nNo Prerequisites; especially suitable for first and second-year students.\nThis is not an old-fashioned \"intro to religions\" course in which you\nlearn several \"facts\"  about some major religions. You will indeed do that.\nBut this course focuses on helping you develop ideas and skills for\nunderstanding religion as a broad category and in specific contexts: a small\nvillage in Thailand, an immigrant community in Appleton, a hospital room\nin Chicago, a Medical School classroom in Madison. It aims to teach you\nhow to recognize and interpret religion and use your understanding for the\n\"health  of others and yourself of human communities.\n\nCourse materials, including required readings, are available via CANVAS.","typicalTopicsAndOrSchedule":"Sample Topics\nDance as Religion and Healing in Africa and the African Diaspora in the U.S.\nA Wisconsin Legal Case about religion and parental responsibility for child health\nSaints and other healing figures\nReligion and Health in Southeast Asia and Southeast Asian Communities in Wisconsin\nShamanism, Healing and Community\nGiving Birth in a Thai Hmong Village\nEnd of Life Choices: Redefining Medicine\nintegrating Native American Culture and Healthcare\nReligion in Hospitals: Nurses on the Front-line\nHow medical decisions are often religious decisions\nElders, Resilience and Covid","format":"2 lecture sessions and 1 discussion session per week.

Yes, it's especially good preparation for students considering careers in health or health-related fields. But since everyone deals with sickness and health at some point and learning about \"what matters\" to people is universally important, this course is relevant for everyone. RS 102 is one of the RS \"gateway\" courses: That is, it's designed for students who want to learn some things about religions and religion in general and we do this via an important theme (sickness/health). \nSkills Building: comparative and interdisciplinary analysis, writing (3 short essays), religious literacy and cultural competency; conversing among multiple viewpoints\nThis is the gateway course for the Religious Studies certificate and major and counts toward the Global Health Certificate.

to RS 102 Exploring Religion in Sickness and Health! Yes, it's especially good preparation for students considering careers in health or health-related fields. But since everyone deals with sickness and health at some point and learning about \"what matters\" to people is universally important, this course is relevant for everyone. RS 102 is one of the RS \"gateway\" courses: That is, it's designed for students who want to learn some things about religions and religion in general and we do this via an important theme (sickness/health). \nSkills Building: comparative and interdisciplinary analysis, writing (3 short essays), religious literacy and cultural competency; conversing among multiple viewpoints\nThis is the gateway course for the Religious Studies certificate and major and counts toward the Global Health Certificate. It is a core course for the Health and Humanities Certificate. The course has 3 FIG sections along with 5 regular sections. You can take it for Soc Sci or HUM credit (Z).  \nCourse Description\nHow do religious peoples understand and live in sickness and health? How\ndoes physical well-being connect to spiritual well-being? Medicine to\nmeaning-making? How does looking at religion in sickness and health\nprovide insight into its roles in different cultures and contexts? What is\n\"religion ? \"Sickness ? \"Health ? How can we understand their\nrelationships? From Southeast Asia to the Caribbean, Africa and the\nMediterranean, we'll approach these questions using perspectives from\nanthropology, history, sociology, legal studies and the medical sciences,\namong others. We'll learn how scholars of religion approach them. And\nwe'll be coming home to Wisconsin and the U.S. along the way to examine these\nquestions as well.\nCourse Learning Objectives\nThoughtful and prepared engagement in this class should lead you ~\n--To begin to develop global religious literacy. To understand some\nsignificant ways in which religious expressions close to home connect\nto situations and cultures around the world, particularly as they relate\nto sickness, health, and healing.\n--To understand something of the diversity of ways in which religion\nboth reflects and shapes human communities and self-conceptions, as\nillustrated mainly by some of the cultures influenced by Buddhism, forms of\nreligion with roots in Africa, and Christianity. (Other traditions are considered as well.)\n--To gain knowledge of and familiarity with some approaches to  interpreting  religion and to use these to examine a variety of religious expressions related to sickness and health. We'll also test these theories against the experiences and practices of people.\n--To learn and begin communicating in a vocabulary of religion and health in the humanities and social sciences and in thoughtful human discourse generally. (We'll learn a little bio-science too.)\n--To gain and practice skills in analytical reading, writing and thinking about religion and particularly its connections to health. These skills are widely applicable to courses and careers outside this\nclass and to being a global citizen and will help you continue to learn beyond this class.\n\nNo Prerequisites; especially suitable for first and second-year students.\nThis is not an old-fashioned \"intro to religions\" course in which you\nlearn several \"facts\"  about some major religions. You will indeed do that.\nBut this course focuses on helping you develop ideas and skills for\nunderstanding religion as a broad category and in specific contexts: a small\nvillage in Thailand, an immigrant community in Appleton, a hospital room\nin Chicago, a Medical School classroom in Madison. It aims to teach you\nhow to recognize and interpret religion and use your understanding for the\n\"health  of others and yourself of human communities.\n\nCourse materials, including required readings, are available via CANVAS.","typicalTopicsAndOrSchedule":"Sample Topics\nDance as Religion and Healing in Africa and the African Diaspora in the U.S.\nA Wisconsin Legal Case about religion and parental responsibility for child health\nSaints and other healing figures\nReligion and Health in Southeast Asia and Southeast Asian Communities in Wisconsin\nShamanism, Healing and Community\nGiving Birth in a Thai Hmong Village\nEnd of Life Choices: Redefining Medicine\nintegrating Native American Culture and Healthcare\nReligion in Hospitals: Nurses on the Front-line\nHow medical decisions are often religious decisions\nElders, Resilience and Covid","format":"2 lecture sessions and 1 discussion session per week.

to RS 102 Exploring Religion in Sickness and Health! Yes, it's especially good preparation for students considering careers in health or health-related fields. But since everyone deals with sickness and health at some point and learning about \"what matters\" to people is universally important, this course is relevant for everyone. RS 102 is one of the RS \"gateway\" courses: That is, it's designed for students who want to learn some things about religions and religion in general and we do this via an important theme (sickness/health). \nSkills Building: comparative and interdisciplinary analysis, writing (3 short essays), religious literacy and cultural competency; conversing among multiple viewpoints\nThis is the gateway course for the Religious Studies certificate and major and counts toward the Global Health Certificate. It is a core course for the Health and Humanities Certificate. The course has 3 FIG sections along with 5 regular sections. You can take it for Soc Sci or HUM credit (Z).  \nCourse Description\nHow do religious peoples understand and live in sickness and health? How\ndoes physical well-being connect to spiritual well-being? Medicine to\nmeaning-making? How does looking at religion in sickness and health\nprovide insight into its roles in different cultures and contexts? What is\n\"religion ? \"Sickness ? \"Health ? How can we understand their\nrelationships? From Southeast Asia to the Caribbean, Africa and the\nMediterranean, we'll approach these questions using perspectives from\nanthropology, history, sociology, legal studies and the medical sciences,\namong others. We'll learn how scholars of religion approach them. And\nwe'll be coming home to Wisconsin and the U.S. along the way to examine these\nquestions as well.\nCourse Learning Objectives\nThoughtful and prepared engagement in this class should lead you ~\n--To begin to develop global religious literacy. To understand some\nsignificant ways in which religious expressions close to home connect\nto situations and cultures around the world, particularly as they relate\nto sickness, health, and healing.\n--To understand something of the diversity of ways in which religion\nboth reflects and shapes human communities and self-conceptions, as\nillustrated mainly by some of the cultures influenced by Buddhism, forms of\nreligion with roots in Africa, and Christianity. (Other traditions are considered as well.)\n--To gain knowledge of and familiarity with some approaches to  interpreting  religion and to use these to examine a variety of religious expressions related to sickness and health. We'll also test these theories against the experiences and practices of people.\n--To learn and begin communicating in a vocabulary of religion and health in the humanities and social sciences and in thoughtful human discourse generally. (We'll learn a little bio-science too.)\n--To gain and practice skills in analytical reading, writing and thinking about religion and particularly its connections to health. These skills are widely applicable to courses and careers outside this\nclass and to being a global citizen and will help you continue to learn beyond this class.\n\nNo Prerequisites; especially suitable for first and second-year students.\nThis is not an old-fashioned \"intro to religions\" course in which you\nlearn several \"facts\"  about some major religions. You will indeed do that.\nBut this course focuses on helping you develop ideas and skills for\nunderstanding religion as a broad category and in specific contexts: a small\nvillage in Thailand, an immigrant community in Appleton, a hospital room\nin Chicago, a Medical School classroom in Madison. It aims to teach you\nhow to recognize and interpret religion and use your understanding for the\n\"health  of others and yourself of human communities.\n\nCourse materials, including required readings, are available via CANVAS.","typicalTopicsAndOrSchedule":"Sample Topics\nDance as Religion and Healing in Africa and the African Diaspora in the U.S.\nA Wisconsin Legal Case about religion and parental responsibility for child health\nSaints and other healing figures\nReligion and Health in Southeast Asia and Southeast Asian Communities in Wisconsin\nShamanism, Healing and Community\nGiving Birth in a Thai Hmong Village\nEnd of Life Choices: Redefining Medicine\nintegrating Native American Culture and Healthcare\nReligion in Hospitals: Nurses on the Front-line\nHow medical decisions are often religious decisions\nElders, Resilience and Covid","format":"2 lecture sessions and 1 discussion session per week. Attendance is crucial and factored into the course grade. Lectures are also \"captured\" on video so that students may review them. Some lecture sessions involve interaction with panels, guest talks by health professionals or faculty, and workshops prior to essay deadlines. \nGrading is based on 3 out of 4 4-page \"take-home\" essays submitted via CANVAS, participation, 4-5 short open-book online quizzes completed outside of class within designated periods but not timed. Essay 4 serves as the \"final\" but is also \"take-home,\" assigned on the final class day and is due by the end of the assigned final exam time (but can be submitted before that). We encourage \"extra credit\" participation in a range of events across campus.","learningOutcome":"See \"skills building\" and Course Learning Goals under Instructor Course Description.","keywords":["religion","spirituality","medicine","health","wellness","cultural competency","science","Global Health","Wisconsin","international studies","nursing","social work","CALS","religious literacy","Buddhism","Hmong","African Americans","Africa","healing","gender","Christianity","Native American","Southeast Asia","United States","pre-health","Health and Humanities"],"labeledURIs":[],"lastUpdated":1678306872000},"published":true,"classPermissionNumberEnabled":false,"sections":[{"classUniqueId":{"termCode":"1242","classNumber":21379},"published":true,"topic":null,"startDate":1693976400000,"endDate":1702447200000,"active":true,"sessionCode":"A1","subject":{"termCode":"1242","subjectCode":"856","description":"RELIGIOUS STUDIES","shortDescription":"RELIG ST","formalDescription":"RELIGIOUS STUDIES","undergraduateCatalogURI":"http://guide.wisc.edu/undergraduate/letters-science/religious-studies/","graduateCatalogURI":"http://guide.wisc.edu/graduate/religious-studies/","departmentURI":"http://religiousstudies.lss.wisc.edu/","uddsFundingSource":"A4834","schoolCollege":{"academicOrgCode":"L","academicGroupCode":"L&S","shortDescription":"Letters and Science","formalDescription":"Letters and Science, College of","uddsCode":null,"schoolCollegeURI":"http://www.ls.wisc.edu/"},"footnotes":["Susan B.
